The repository is some of the projects that I've been taking for the course of web development from the teacher Juan on the Plataform Udemy. I learned how to get the values from the HTML and insert them into the Classes of JS. Also, I worked on how to validate each label on the form to create an alert if the text that is inserted is not the type that is required.
